# 📌 Use Case Readiness Check (LLM Project)

Use this checklist before building anything. It helps determine whether your use case is **well-suited for a Large Language Model (LLM)** and whether your team is ready to move forward.

---

## ✅ 1. Use Case Clarity

- [ ] Can we clearly explain what the AI is supposed to do?
- [ ] Is the goal achievable using **language** as input/output?
- [ ] Have we written a basic example prompt + expected output?

> Example: “Summarise a customer support transcript in 3 bullet points.”

---

## ❓ 2. LLM Fit

- [ ] Does this task involve text, natural language, or classification?
- [ ] Is creativity, summarisation, or open-ended reasoning required?
- [ ] Would a **rule-based or traditional model** be better suited?

> If you're just labeling structured data, you may not need an LLM.

---

## 📊 3. Business Value & Constraints

- [ ] Is there a clear benefit (speed, accuracy, scalability)?
- [ ] Do we understand the cost of API use or model hosting?
- [ ] Are there clear boundaries for what the model **must not do**?

---

## 👥 4. Team Readiness

- [ ] Do we have someone who understands LLMs and prompts?
- [ ] Is there a test plan or evaluation method in mind?
- [ ] Are key stakeholders aware of risks and limitations?

---

## ✅ Summary & Scorecard

Count how many boxes you checked:

- **7–10**: 🚀 Ready to explore! Move to [Getting Started Checklist](../checklist/01_getting-started.md)
- **4–6**: 🔍 Clarify goals, risks, or tech fit before building
- **<4**: 🛑 Rethink if an LLM is the right tool or if the team is prepared
