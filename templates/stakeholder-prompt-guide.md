## 💬 Questions to Ask Internal Stakeholders

| Team | What to Ask |
|------|-------------|
| **Legal / Risk** | Are we allowed to use this type of data or model? What needs review? |
| **IT / Security** | Are there security concerns with API calls or self-hosted models? |
| **Marketing / Comms** | Will this affect public messaging or user trust? |
| **Operations / CX** | Does this change how we serve or support customers? |
| **Data Governance** | Does the input data meet policy or regulatory requirements? |

## 🎯 Discussion Prompts for Kickoff Meetings

- “Here’s what this LLM project will do, and what it **won’t** do...”
- “We’re using [insert model type] and here's why...”
- “The outputs may vary—how should we define **acceptable use**?”
- “How will we escalate issues if the system behaves unexpectedly?”
- “What will success look like for each team involved?”

## 📌 Tips for Smooth Stakeholder Engagement

- Involve stakeholders **early**—not just at launch
- Share a **simple one-pager** summarizing the project
- Use visual examples (sample outputs or mockups)
- Flag what’s **experimental vs. production-ready**
- Avoid tech jargon—focus on impact and outcomes
