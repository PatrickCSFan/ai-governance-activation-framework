# 🔄 Iteration & Scaling Checklist (LLM Projects)

Starting small is smart—but **scaling responsibly is key**. This final checklist helps your team **reflect, adapt, and improve** your governance as your AI projects grow.

Use it after your initial launch, or as part of a retrospective.

---

## 🔁 1. Review What You’ve Learned

- [ ] Did the LLM behave as expected in real use?
- [ ] What surprised you—technically, socially, or politically?
- [ ] What feedback did users or stakeholders share?

> Learning loops are essential for responsible AI. Even small notes now help future projects.

---

## 🧱 2. Improve Your Governance Practices

- [ ] Are you updating the project log or checklist for the next team?
- [ ] Should you templatize what worked for future pilots?
- [ ] Did any **gaps** emerge that need new guidance or policy?

💡 Responsible governance grows by **iteration**, not paperwork.

---

## 🪴 3. Plan for Scaling

- [ ] Will this LLM system expand to new users, markets, or data types?
- [ ] Are current **roles, safeguards, or review points** still enough?
- [ ] Do we need to involve new functions (legal, compliance, risk)?

> The more impact your system has, the more care it needs.

## 🧰 4. Prepare for Maturity (If Needed)

As your org matures in AI adoption, you might need:

- A central AI governance playbook
- Audit trails or documentation templates
- Integration with legal or risk workflows
- Formal sign-off or model registration processes
