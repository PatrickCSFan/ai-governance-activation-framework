# 👥 Accountability & Role Clarity (LLM Projects)

Clear roles reduce confusion, surface risks earlier, and help projects move forward responsibly. This is especially true for **AI systems using Large Language Models (LLMs)**, where output quality, ethical risks, and impact can vary.

This checklist helps you define **who is doing what** and **who is ultimately accountable**.

---

## 🎯 1. Define Core Roles

- [ ] Who is the **Project Owner**? (usually product or innovation lead)
- [ ] Who manages the **technical integration or model selection**?
- [ ] Who handles **data sourcing** and validates its quality?
- [ ] Who will test and **evaluate outputs for safety or bias**?
- [ ] Who is the **go-to stakeholder** for ethical, legal, or customer trust concerns?

💡 Use the [Role Mapping Template](../templates/role-mapping-template.md) to capture these clearly.

## 🧩 2. Understand “Ownership” vs. “Accountability”

| Term          | What It Means                                      | Example                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Owner**     | Drives the task forward day-to-day                  | PM managing timeline and scope          |
| **Accountable** | Responsible if things go wrong; makes final calls | VP, CPO, or Legal lead                  |
| **Contributor** | Executes or provides input                        | Engineer, analyst, UX researcher        |

> Each project should have **at least one named person** in the “Accountable” column.

## 🧪 3. Assign Responsibility for Output Risks

- [ ] Who reviews model outputs for safety and relevance?
- [ ] Who signs off on deployment into real user environments?
- [ ] Who monitors for errors, misuse, or drift post-launch?

Even if you’re **just calling an API**, your team is responsible for:
- How prompts are crafted
- How outputs are used
- Who is affected by them

---

## 📢 4. Bring in “Non-Tech” Voices Early

- [ ] Have you included someone from legal, ethics, or operations?
- [ ] Are marketing or CX teams aware of this project’s impact?
- [ ] Are there frontline staff who should be consulted?

> Responsible AI is **cross-functional** by nature. Don’t wait until launch to engage others.
