## 📌 What Is This?

This is a practical, open-source toolkit for enterprise teams working with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**—including both **closed-source APIs** (like OpenAI or Anthropic) and **open-weight models** (like Meta LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, or DeepSeek).

You’ll find checklists, templates, and educational content to navigate common early-stage questions like:

- Are we using the right kind of LLM for our use case?
- What are the risks of using open-weight models?
- Who is accountable for model decisions?
- How do we talk about data, fairness, or transparency?

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- Product & innovation managers exploring AI use cases
- Technical teams without formal AI governance resources
- Cross-functional groups launching LLM pilots or internal tools
