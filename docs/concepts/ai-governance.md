# 🏛️ What Is AI Governance?

**AI Governance** refers to the systems, policies, and processes that ensure AI technologies are used **responsibly, safely, and in alignment with organizational goals**.

It helps teams answer:  
> “Who is responsible for this AI system—and how do we make sure it behaves appropriately?”

## 🧭 Why Governance Is Needed

As AI—especially Large Language Models (LLMs)—becomes more powerful and widely adopted, governance ensures:
- AI is used ethically and safely
- Risk is identified and managed early
- Roles and decisions are clearly documented
- Systems align with business values and public expectations

## 🧱 Key Components of AI Governance

| Component           | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Strategy**        | Align AI with business goals |
| **Accountability**  | Assign owners and reviewers |
| **Policies**        | Rules for data, model use, and risk |
| **Controls**        | Guardrails to prevent misuse or harm |
| **Documentation**   | Clear records of decisions and rationale |

## 🏢 What It Looks Like in a Company

- A checklist before launching an AI experiment
- Model review boards or ethics committees
- Internal policies for data, privacy, and monitoring
- Documented approval steps before releasing an LLM to production

> You don’t need a huge committee. Even one checklist and clear ownership can be governance.
