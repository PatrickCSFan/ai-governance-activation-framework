# 🛡️ What Is AI Safety?

**AI Safety** focuses on ensuring that AI systems—especially advanced or autonomous ones—**don’t cause harm** to individuals, organizations, or society.

It asks the question:  
> “Could this AI system behave in dangerous or unpredictable ways?”

## ⚠️ Why It’s Important

Even helpful AI systems can:
- Make mistakes at scale (e.g. faulty automation)
- Be misused (e.g. generating fake news or malware)
- Fail in surprising ways (e.g. hallucinating false outputs)

AI safety helps prevent:
- **Physical harm** (e.g. robotics, autonomous driving)
- **Societal harm** (e.g. bias, disinformation)
- **Security threats** (e.g. prompt injection or jailbreaking)

## 🧪 Key AI Safety Practices

| Practice                    | Example |
|----------------------------|---------|
| **Red teaming**            | Testing LLMs for dangerous behaviors |
| **Adversarial testing**    | Probing for manipulations or exploitability |
| **Failsafes & monitoring** | Catching runaway behavior or misuse early |
| **Access controls**        | Restricting model capabilities (e.g. who can prompt or deploy) |

## 🔄 AI Safety vs. AI Alignment

| Term           | Focus Area                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **AI Alignment** | Make AI do what we want        |
| **AI Safety**     | Make sure it doesn't do harm   |

You can have **aligned but unsafe** systems (e.g. following instructions too literally).  
You can also have **safe but misaligned** systems (e.g. filtered but unhelpful).
