# ðŸ“‹ Role Mapping Template (LLM Project Kickoff)

Use this template to define **who is responsible** for what in your LLM project. Assign real names, not just titles. Clear roles prevent friction, delays, and confusion later.

> Tip: Not every role must be filled on Day 1, but someone should own each dimension before production.
